# MLOps Principal for machine learning model to predict Customer Chrun
clean coding principal for machine learning production ready mlops practice 

## Project Description

This project is Machine learning Operation process of converting jupyter notebook based model into deployable script with clean coding principal. This project follow some basics steps to start with MLOps steps for any machine learnig projects:

- Clean coding best practice
- Update with version control 
- Testing & Logging 

The aim of the project is to predict **customer churn** using basic classification model Logistics Regression and ensamble model Random Forest.

### Files & Runnning Discriptions:


> churn_library.py

Holds all the functions required to perform the model training and prediction

> churn_script_logging_and_tests.py

Holds test functions to test the functions defined in churn_library.py


> python/ipython python predictor.py
> python/ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
